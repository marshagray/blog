Today we’re at the Green River KOA and we’ll be here for 7 days.  That’s the longest we’ve stayed in any location.

Seems like we always meet new friends at the swimming pool, but last night was chillay so we headed to the hot tub.  A couple came in and sat down beside us and we started chatting.  He was probably close to 50 and covered in tattoos over 60-70% of his body.  Sounds bad but he was a nice looking guy and didn’t look creepy at all.  She was a tall slender blonde in her 40s.  Come to find out they were professional disc golf players and they travel the country/world doing so.  He has been competing for 13 years and has over 100 tournament wins.  She has competed in the Women’s Nationals multiple times.  It was fun learning about disc golf since I didn’t even know that it was a thing, professionally speaking.

.We’re super excited!  We’re looking forward to some MELON-MUNCHING FUN this weekend!  The 116th annual Melon Festial is taking place in Green River.  Who knew??!  Certainly it me when I planned our stay here.  But such a bonus!  Apparently Green River is know for all of its different types of melons and they’re all supposed to be super sweet!  We bought a couple this afternoon.  We cut open the Israeli melon and it is delicious.  It’s the one with the darker markings on it.  We also bought a Canary melon that we will try tomorrow.

So the festival starts tomorrow and there will be a parade, free samplings of melons and lots of venues set up in the city parK.  We’ll get to see the famous watermelon float!  Should be fun!!!  And, by the way, the weather is beautiful.  Highs in the lower 80s and lows in the upper 50s. Great sleeping weather!  

More exciting news…My journal may be turning into a blog soon.  Alex has set up and template for me to use…now all I need are step-by-step instructions on how to build it.  We’re going to FaceTime tomorrow.  Keep your fingers crossed that it’s simple to do.  Grandma’s not as computer literate as I would like to believe.  :)
